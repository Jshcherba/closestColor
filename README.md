# closestColor
Hi there!
Using this pseudo app you can get the closest color(s) for one you need.
You can find a form with 3 elements

Input
Textarea
Button

Please paste color VALUE you want to find closest to (like #69849b) into the input
Please paste color variables from your _variables.scss file into the textarea
$brand-primary: #69849b; format
And then submit the button by clicking the submit button

Why we need this? There are situations when comps contain color that is not listed in styleguide.
Depending on the situation we should wether add that color to styleguide or replace it with closest one from styleguide.
So basically this app helps to find such a color. Enjoy.

P.S. Separate thank you to Yuri Kletsun for HSV code.
